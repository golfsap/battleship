# Battleship

A JavaScript implementation of the classic **Battleship** game, built using **test-driven development (TDD)** with **Jest**. The project follows the TDD approach, where tests were written before the actual implementation to ensure a reliable and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Test-driven development**: All game logic was developed with Jest unit tests.
- **Object-oriented structure**: Modular design with separate components for **Gameboard, Ship, Player, and Computer-ai**.
- **AI opponent**: The computer uses a smart attack strategy with hunt-and-target algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Jest** (for testing)
- **Webpack** (for bundling)
- **HTML & CSS** (for UI)

## Test-Driven Development

This project was developed using **TDD principles**, ensuring that the game logic was fully tested before implementation. Key test cases include:  
**Ship functions** – Placement, hits, and sinking behavior.  
**Gameboard mechanics** – Attack handling, ship placement validation.  
**Player & AI behavior** – Turn-based gameplay, AI attack logic.
